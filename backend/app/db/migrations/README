This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for the AI Auditing backend.

Use the helpers provided in the `Makefile` (e.g., `make db-upgrade`) to apply
migrations locally. Auto-generated revisions should live under the `versions/`
folder, following the naming convention `<timestamp>_<slug>.py`.
